# Personal-website
It is a personal website made for fun and to improve my skills.
Note that all pictures are not mine but used in place of the parts that allows me to add an image.
it is inspired by Tutorials Dev on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX3ikOsQg58.
Also images are downloaded from pexels https://www.pexels.com/.
